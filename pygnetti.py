# here, we assume that mu_0 is 4*pi*1E-7. This simplifies the expressions used
# for computation. One might need to change to the international definition,
# by using the scipy library: "https://scipy.org/" where the constant mu_0 can
# be found. Use then instead: "from scipy.constants import mu_0"

# The coil axis is aligned along Oz. The current is 1A by default. The units of
# length are the mm, and the magnetic units are the mT. The "radius" parameter
# represents the bore of the coil, the coil being centred on the origin. The
# layer filling is assumed to be compact (a triangular stacking from a cross
# section view). The wire diameter is derived from the height and the number of
# turns. The number of turns alternates, with n turns on even layers, and n-1
# turns on odd layers. The first layer (number 0) is always defined as even.
# No coil is ever perfectly wound, however, the compact model with alternating
# even and odd number of turns cannot be not too far from how a real coil looks
# like, especially when a small diameter wire is used. Other models should be
# easy to program.
